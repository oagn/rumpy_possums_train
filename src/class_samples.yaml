## Set the default number of sample images per class to be trained each epoch, for those classes not specified below.
default: 4000

# Below you can specify the number of random samples to draw from the selected training classes per epoch. This allows for a more balanced training set.
# With many epochs or large samples, the model will eventualy see all samples, but with fewer epochs, the model will see a random subset of the samples.
# If the number specified is greater than the number of training images in the class, the samples will be drawn with replacement.

# Format = no. samples : [class1, class2, ...] where class can be a text (e.g., deer) or an integer (e.g., 13)
#specific:
#  3000: [13, 11]
#  2000: [3]
#  1000: [1, 2, 7]
